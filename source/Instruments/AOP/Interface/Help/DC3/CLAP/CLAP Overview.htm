<h1>Continuous Light Absorption Photometer</h1>
</h2>General Description</h2>
<p>The Continuous Light Absorption Photometer (CLAP) is similar to the Radiance Research Particle Soot/Absorption Photometer (PSAP) in that it is a filter-based light absorption measurement. It differs from the PSAP in that it utilizes solenoid valves to cycle through 8 sample filter spots and 2 reference filter spots, enabling the instrument to run at ideal conditions (filter transmittance, Tr, greater than 0.7) eight times as long as the single sample filter spot PSAP. The CLAP uses 47-mm diameter, glass-fiber filters (Pallflex type E70-2075W), identical to the PSAP filters except for size. These filters are made of two fibrous layers, borosilicate glass fibers overlaying a cellulose fiber backing material (for strength and stability). The cellulose fiber layer is thought to take up water under conditions of high humidity, which is one reason that CLAP has an internal heater to lower the sample relative humidity inside the instrument. The CLAP is typically installed so that it draws its sample air from through a modified TSI nephelometer blower bypass block. The CLAP vacuum line is connected to system vacuum (in the NOAA aerosol system that means connecting to a port on the manifold block in the CN box or 'tee-ing' off a vacuum line such as the PSAP vacuum line). </p>
