<h1>Changing the Filter</h1>
<p>Changing the CLAP filter takes less than five minutes. Tools required are a torque driver, replacement filter, tweezers, zip-closure plastic bag, and a permanent marker.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make a note of the CLAP flowrate, as you will need to compare with the flowrate after the filter change.</li>
<li>Press the red button on the front panel to signal the start of a filter change. The red indicator light will turn on to indicate that the CLAP is in filter changing mode.
<li>Unscrew the four nuts on the top of the panel using the torque driver, remove the lid, and lay it carefully to the side of the instrument.</li>
<li>Remove the filter. Place the filter in a small zip-closure bag and label the bag with the station name and the date the filter was pulled out of the CLAP. The label should have the format: YYMMDD-STN (so December 13, 2000 at Trinidad Head (THD) would be labeled: 001213-THD). Write your initials on the bag.</li>
<li>Make sure that the top and bottom surface of the filter holder are clean – use a tissue and ethanol to remove any dirt or obstructions. Use the tweezers to take a new filter from the supply box, making sure that you only took a single filter (sometimes two filters may stick together). Place a new filter in the filter holder, with the white side of the filter facing up. Secure the lid on the CLAP by replacing the lid and tightening the 4 nuts using the torque driver. The torque driver will click when the proper amount of torque has been applied. Note: the lid only fits on one way.</li>
<li>Press the red button to signal that the filter change is complete. The red lamp should turn off.</li>
<li>The CLAP will not begin sampling automatically after a filter change. External software must issue commands to the CLAP to begin sampling. The NOAA 'cpd' software will take care of this automatically (see section 3), otherwise the appropriate commands must be issued manually.</li>
<li>Once the CLAP begins sampling after the filter change, compare the flowrate with the value before the filter change. The flowrate should not decrease. If this happens, you should repeat the filter change, in case two filters were stuck together.</li>
