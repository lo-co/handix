<h1>Power Distribution in the AOP</h1>
<p>The front panels of the power distribution boxes are shown in the figures below.  In the case of the AOP instrument, there are two boxes: one on the side containing the PAS head and one on the side containing the CRDS head.  In both cases, bottons labeled "CB" are circuit breakers that control power to the particular device on the label.  Ultimately, all power whether AC or DC is routed through this box and in any case, the AC master (CB1 on the PAS side) will have to be in (on) to operate anything in the rack.</p>
<p>In addition to power on the PAS side, many signals are also routed through the PAS side power distribution box.  These include all signals that go through the PXI chassis as well as the RS-232 I/O for the mass flow controller bank.</p>
