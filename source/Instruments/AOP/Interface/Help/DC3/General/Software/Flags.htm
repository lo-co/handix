<Title>Filter Flag</Title>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
The status flag is a single byte that contains the status of several UI flags:
<ol>
	<li>Auto speaker - speaker switches on fixed duty cycle</li>
	<li>Link speaker to filter cycles</li>
	<li>Bypass - system is set to bypass filter and sample for calibrations</li>
	<li>AutoFilter</li>
	<li>O3 - set by user to indicate O3 cals</li>
	<li>Filter position</li>
</ol>
If 0 AND 1 AND NOT (2 OR 4), then the speaker will automatically turn on when flow is switched to filter.

If 4 then 0 AND 3 are disregarded.
