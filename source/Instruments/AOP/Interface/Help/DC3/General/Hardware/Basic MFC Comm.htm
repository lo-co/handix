<h1>Basic Commands</h1>

<p>Most of the time, the user will only need to access the controllers to a) check communication and retrieve data from the controller or 2) change the setpoint.  A simple query only requires the address.  So, in the box in the image below labeled "Select or Enter Command", the user will simply type the addrss and then hit the button labeled "Query".  This will provide a string that will be dependent on the controller type.  However, for those controllers above, the formatted string will be 6 columns with the order of the data being: pressure (psia), temperature (&deg;C), volumetric flow rate, mass flow rate and flow rate setpoint.  The units of the flow rates will be dependent on the settings and the model. </p>
<p>To send a command to change the flow rate, the user will provide the model immediately proceeded by the flow rate.  the flow rate itself is an integer number ranging from 0 to 64,000.  The maximum represents the maximum of the range (so for the 5lpm models, 64,000 represents 5 lpm).  The range is linear, so the value 32,000 will represent half of the maximum possible flow rate.  So, if the user wishes to set the flow rate to half the maximum, the user will give the command <i>A32000</i>, where <i>A</i> is the address, and then select the button labeled "Query".  If the controller is properly set up, it will respond with the same return string as stated above.  If it is not properly configured, it will respond with an error.</p>
