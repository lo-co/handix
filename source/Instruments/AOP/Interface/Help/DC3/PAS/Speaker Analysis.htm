<h1>Speaker Analysis</h1>
<p>For calibrating the resonance features of the PAS cells, we go through the cycle shown in the block diagram below.  At a rate of 1 Hz, a "chirp" is emitted from a speaker located in the PAS cavity.  This "chirp" is a wave which produces a tophat like structure in the frequency domain.  In the current configuration, </p>

<p>In physics, the Lorentzian distribution describes forced resonance.  For the photoacoustic, we use the Lorentzian to characterize the speaker signal via the retrieved power spectrum (this will be the square of the amplitude, or C^2=A^2+B^2, where A is the coefficient of the real terms in the FFT and B is the coefficient for the imaginary terms).  The Lorentzian function is defined as </p>

<p>where <i>f</i> is the frequency, <i>a<sub>0</sub></i> is an offset attributable to a constant background noise (be it electronic or acoustic in nature),  and <i>a<sub>2</sub></i> is the resonant frequency <i>f<sub>0</sub></i>, or the median of the distribution where the function is at a max.  From these values, the max may be calculated as</p>

<p>and the full width half maximum (<i>FWHM</i>) is solved using the  above equations and can be written as</p>
<img src="IMG\FWHM.jpg" vspace = "10"/>
<p>This value holds regardless of the offset in the distribution <i>a<sub>0</sub></i>.  From these values, we have the resonant frequency <i>a<sub>2</sub></i> and can calculate the quality of the resonance</p>
