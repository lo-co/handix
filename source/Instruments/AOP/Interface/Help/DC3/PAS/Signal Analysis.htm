<h1>Speaker</h1>
<p>For calibrating the resonance features of the PAS cells, we go through the cycle shown in the block diagram below.  At a rate of 1 Hz, a "chirp" is emitted from a speaker located in the PAS cavity.  This "chirp" is a wave which produces a tophat like structure in the frequency domain.  In the current configuration, </p>

<p>In physics, the Lorentzian distribution describes forced resonance.  For the photoacoustic, we use the Lorentzian to characterize the speaker signal via the retrieved power spectrum (this will be the square of the amplitude, or C^2=A^2+B^2, where A is the coefficient of the real terms in the FFT and B is the coefficient for the imaginary terms).  The Lorentzian function is defined as </p>>
