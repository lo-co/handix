		<dt><i>&tau;</i><sub>0</sub></dt>
			<dd>The decay time constant calculated in aerosol free air.  In the software, this value is referred to as tau0.  Both this value and the one described below are averaged over the entire period the flow is filtered.  In each case, the first five shots are disregarded during the filter period as these values may be influenced by aerosol obtained prior to the switch from sample flow to filtered flow.
Both <i>&tau;<sub>0</sub></i> and the corrected value are averaged while the instrument samples on filter.  The time over which the sample is acquired is variable, but the default is 5 seconds.  Practically, we remove the last data point sampled before the filter change (back to sample) to avoid any anomalous data points </dd>
		<dt><i>&tau;</i>'<sub>0</sub></dt>
			<dd><p>The decay time constant calculated in aerosol free air corrected for Rayleigh scattering.  This value in &micron;s is obtained using the following formula:</p>
