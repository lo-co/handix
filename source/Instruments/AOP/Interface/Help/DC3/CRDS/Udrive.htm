<h1>Raw Tau Acquisition with the U Drive</h1>
If the user desires, the ability to write &tau;'s (all 8000 a second) is now available.  The interface contains an indicator which tells the user whether a properly formatted jump drive is available (this is called U).  If it is, then the taus will automatically begin writing to a file under a folder labeled by date.  For each file generated (one will be generated each time the drive is connected or disconnected), the title of the file will be tausyyyyddmm_hhmmss.bin.  In order to properly remove the disk without the danger of corruption to the file, the disk must be ejected.  In order to do this, select File->Eject U Drive on the interface.  Once the disk is "ejected", then this option is grayed out and the drive is no longer being written to.
A couple of things to keep in mind:
<ul>
<li>The drive is hot-swappable (meaning you can take it out or put it in at any point), just remember to eject the disk first so that nothing bad happens. </li>
<li>You are writing 8k floating point  samples a second to disk.  This translates to roughly 32 kb/s, or > 1 Mb/min.  Currently there are no checks to make sure you are not writing past the capacity of the disk, so make sure you size your disk appropriately for the amount of time you plan to have it connected.</li>
<li>The data is saved as:
	<ul>
	<li>Time (dbl precision)</li>
	<li>Array size (32-bit int)</li>
	<li>Array of floats (each 32-bit)</li>
	</ul></li>
<li>The disk used to save data must be formatted as FAT.  It will be very evident on the user interface if it is not as the drive will not be indicated as connected.</li>
<li>Every time the drive is accessed, there will be a file with a time that the drive was initially accessed called 'status_check.txt'.  I use this file to monitor the connection status of the drive.  Don't worry about this file, just expect to see it as I don't clean it up currently.</li>
</ul>
The image below shows the interface with the U drive indicator circled.  When the U drive is connected (i.e. when there is a FAT formatted USB drive connected to the chassis), this indicator will be lit.  Also, when the U drive is being written to the menu selection "Eject U Drive" will be enabled and the user will select this to properly eject the drive without causing writing errors.  The indicator on the right will still be lit indicating that the drive is present, but the menu selection will be disabled.  The indicator will remain lit until the drive is actually removed from the chassis.
