<h3>Particle Signal Amplification and Tracking</h3>
<p>The detector photodiodes produce a photocurrent, which the analog chain then converts to a voltage. The system then processes the resulting signal, which is called the particle signal. The chain is repeated for the primary and secondary detection systems.</p>
<p>After the photodiode transimpedence amplifier magnifies the particle signal, it is mixed with a signal derived from the reference detection system for drift detection.</p>
<p>The particle signal is fed into two different detectors, differing in gain as specified below. In total there are four gain stages: high and low for each of the primary and secondary detection systems.</p>

    <thead>
    	<tr>
        	<th scope="col"></th>
            <th scope="col">High gain</th>
            <th scope="col">Low Gain</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
<tr><td>Primary detector</td><td>G3</td><td>G2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Secondary detector</td><td>G1</td><td>G0</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>Gain ratios:
G3/G2 = 50
G2/G1 = 20
G1/G0 = 20</p>
<p>The gain ratios G3:G2 and G1:G0 are pure electrical amplification gain ratios. The G2:G1 ratio is more complicated, since it involves two independent photodetectors with independent electronics that are on opposite sides of the optical block.</p>
<p>The gain stages also provide low-pass filtering to the signal. Each gain stage then feeds its own baseline restoration circuit. This restores the 0 Volt baseline, which is disturbed by frequent particle signals after AC coupling. The particle signal is then passed to a peak-hold circuit, which tracks the rise of the signal as a particle crosses the laser and holds the peak value. The digital system then processes the signal and issues a reset.</p>
<h3>Laser Power Monitoring</h3>
<p>The reference detector is used as a voltage reference and automatic gain control. It is also used for monitoring laser output power, which is directly proportional to the laser cavity power. As the laser power drifts, the instrument maintains calibration. Only large drifts in power (> 25%) require a recalibration of the instrument, since the automatic gain control mostly compensates for small drifts, and the particle sizing sensitivity is a sixth-root function of laser power.</p>
