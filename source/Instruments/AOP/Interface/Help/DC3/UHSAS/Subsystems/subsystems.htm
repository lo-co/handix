<h1>Subsystems</h1>
The instrument consists of 5 general subsystems, described in this section:

<ol>
	<li>Main optical subsystem generates the laser light, detects the light scattered by particles, and provides a mechanical enclosure for the optical system and for delivery of the sample aerosol</li>
	<li>Flow system brings the sample aerosol through the optical interaction region, controls and measures the flows</li>
	<li>Analog electronics system amplifies and processes the particle signals</li>
	<li>Digital electronics system analyzes particle signals, bins signals according to user-specified bin mappings, generates a histogram of particles in the specified bins, and communicates with the PC and system monitor/control functions</li>
	<li>Onboard PC allows user to control instrument and collect and report data</li>
</ol>
