<BODY>
<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The UHSAS is an optical-scattering, laser-based aerosol particle spectrometer system for sizing particles in the 0.06 - 1 &mu;m range. The instrument counts particles in up to 100 user-specified sizing bins.  The instrument’s laser illuminates particles, which scatter light. The system captures the peak light signals that are generated. These signals are used for particle sizing, since the amount of light scattered correlates strongly with particle size.  The instrument consists of 5 general subsystems, described in this section:

<ol>
	<li>Main optical subsystem generates the laser light, detects the light scattered by particles, and provides a mechanical enclosure for the optical system and for delivery of the sample aerosol</li>
	<li>Flow system brings the sample aerosol through the optical interaction region, controls and measures the flows</li>
	<li>Analog electronics system amplifies and processes the particle signals</li>
	<li>Digital electronics system analyzes particle signals, bins signals according to user-specified bin mappings, generates a histogram of particles in the specified bins, and communicates with the PC and system monitor/control functions</li>
	<li>Onboard PC allows user to control instrument and collect and report data</li>
