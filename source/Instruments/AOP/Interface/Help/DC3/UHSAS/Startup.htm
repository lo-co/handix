<h1>Startup Instructions for the UHSAS</h1>
<ol>
<li>Open on/off valve exiting flow shelf and check 3-way valve at rear of UHSAS</li>
<li>Check water level in sight tubes and add distilled water as needed. Eliminate all bubbles from water line</li>
<li>Engage circuit breaker at rear of UHSAS</li>
<li>Turn on AC#1 breaker on rack power distribution box. Note: do NOT run UHSAS for longer than 1 minute without using the laptop and LabView program</li>
<li>Start "Spectrometer" LabView program</li>
<li>Go to "Controls" tab and check that flows are on. IMPORTANT: check that Laser Temperature setting is 1.23 V and that the measured laser temperature is controlling within 0.04 V of this valueSometimes this does not control and a runaway could damage the laser. If it not controlling, cycle the power.  <b>NOTE: AFTER ENTERING A VALUE IN ANY BOX, YOU MUST CLICK OUTSIDE THE BOX TO UPDATE THAT SETTING. PRESSING THE "ENTER" KEY DOESN'T DO IT.</b></li>

<li>If no measurements are appearing or are not updating there is a COM error:
  	<ul>
		<li>Go to the "Configuration" tab</li>
		<li>In the password box enter "delt" and press the "enter password" button</li>
		<li>Select a new COM port, such as COM 9 (COM 3 should be default), and press the "revert mode" button</li>
		<li>Return to the password box, enter "delt" and press the button again</li>
		<li>Select COM 3, then press the "revert mode" button</li>

		<li>Set RH control value to 85%</li>
		<li>You should see temps and RH values begin to control over a few minutes</li>
	</ol></li>

<li>Go to "histogram" tab
	<ol> 
		<li>Make sure data acquisition time is set to 1 second</li>
		<li>Make sure "run" button is enabled</li>
