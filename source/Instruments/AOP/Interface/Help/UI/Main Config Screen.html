    <h3>Exponential Fit Method </h3>
    <p>These controls set the fitting method for the cells associated
      with the three different lasers.&nbsp; Common methods for
      analyzing exponential traces traditionally include a linear
      least-squares fit corrected for a baseline offset and the
      Levenberg-Marquardt non-linear least squares technique.&nbsp; Due
      to the number of traces that are fit in a single second (8000 for
      a pulse rate of 1 kHz), both of these methodologies are
      insufficient due to available execution time without
      coadding.&nbsp; Three different techniques have been outlined in
      recent literature that provide an efficient methodology for
      fitting ringdown traces with high accuracy.&nbsp; These techniques
      are defined in the available options of the <span
        style="font-weight: bold;">Exponential Fit Method </span>box as
      DFT-1, DFT-5 and LRS.&nbsp; Each of these methods requires no
      baseline for fitting data and is of an order of magnitude faster
      than the non-linear algorithm of Levenberg-Marquardt. <br>
    </p>
    <h4>LRS</h4>
    <p>Linear regression of the sums, or LRS, is a technique defined in
      <span style="font-style: italic;">Everest and Atkinson </span>[2008].











      &nbsp;LRS is the retangular integration solution of linear least
      squares, this techniques solves the following linear system <br>
    </p>
    <div style="text-align: center;"> | N SI&nbsp; St&nbsp;&nbsp;
      |&nbsp; | a<sub>0</sub> | = |Sf |<br>
      | SI SII StI |&nbsp; | a<sub>1</sub> | = |SfI |<br>
      | St StI Stt&nbsp; |&nbsp; | a<sub>2</sub> | = |Sft |<br>
    </div>
    <p> where N is the numberr of points in the exponential and Sx
      represents the sum of term x and Sxy represents the sum of the
      product of two terms at each point evaluated.&nbsp; I is the
      running integral of the signal x (evaluated using rectangular
      integration, or &#931;(f<sub>i</sub>*t<sub>i</sub>) where f is the
      value of the exponential at point<span style="font-style: italic;">
        i</span> and <span style="font-style: italic;">t</span> is the
      time at point <span style="font-style: italic;">i</span> (in this
      case, &#916;t is = 1).&nbsp; The matrix <span style="font-weight:
        bold;">A</span> is positive definite (apparent from the
      structure above) and we can use Cholesky decomposition to solve
      for the vector <span style="font-weight: bold;">a</span>.&nbsp;
      We can then evaluate&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;"></span><span
        style="font-style: italic;">&#964;</span> using this vector:<br>
    </p>
    <div style="text-align: center;">&nbsp; 1/<span style="font-style:
        italic;">&#964;</span> = ln(1-a<sub>1</sub>)<br>
      <div style="text-align: left;"><br>
      </div>
      <div style="text-align: left;">
        <h4>DFT-1 and DFT-5<br>
        </h4>
        <p>The DFT-1 (and -5) methods map the exponential decay into the
          frequency domain [<span style="font-style: italic;">Mazurenka
            et al.</span>, 2005].&nbsp; Calculate &#964; from the first
          frequency component of the DFT using:<br>
        </p>
        <div style="text-align: center;">1/&#964; =
          1/&#916;t*ln(Re(F(k)/Im(F(k)*sin(w<sub>k</sub>*&#916;t) + cos(w<sub>k</sub>*&#916;t))<br>
        </div>
        <p> where k = 1 and assuming unit spacing in time.</p>
        <h3 style="text-align: left;"> Sampling Rate</h3>
        <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">NOT IMPLEMENTED.</span>&nbsp;
          The sampling rate defines the rate at which ringdown times are
          calculated and returned.&nbsp; Different sampling rates<br>
