Before you can run any RH Systems DAQ program 
on your computer, you must also install the 
correct version of LabVIEW Runtime Engine and
the VISA driver. If they are not installed, or
are the wrong version, the DAQ program will not
execute properly.

Note:  The LabView Runtime Engine and the VISA
driver need only be installed once.
