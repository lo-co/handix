# Thermistors

Added a configuration file element to handle the thermistors that have been purchased by Handix.  The thermistors come with their own custom calibration.  The manufacturer has probvided both a LUT of temperature versus thermistor resistance as well as the Steinhart-Hart-Hall coefficients.  The INI file will take advantage of this new setup with the following entries:

```ini
[Thermistors]
; SHH for the thermistors; the coefficients go as A,B,C,D
; The values below are for thermistor 135272-001
Thermistor 1 = 1.11711507E-03,2.36774386E-04,6.39843406E-08,7.41113584E-11
; These coefficients are for 135272-002
Thermistor 2 = 8.96558965E-04,2.80334964E-04,-2.49151270E-07,1.06658433E-09
```

We can add more thermistors - these should be labeled ``Thermistor n`` where ``n`` is the thermistor number.  The key contains a comma-delimited array of floats representing the SHH coefficients ``A,B,C,D``.  The code has been adjusted to accomodate the SHH equation using 4 coefficients.  These coefficients are stored in the ``Open Path CRD::SHH`` property which is read in at config time.  The array returned from the FPGA read in routine will be looped through and hte coefficients for each thermistor will be applied.

Started a project page at http://lo-co.github.io/handix.  Nothing really there but I want this to be a standard practice for reporting progress of the project.
