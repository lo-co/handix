## Buck CR5

Working with the Buck chilled mirror and there are several issues of note.  

* If the mirror is not attached (i.e. we are just hooked up to the board) we will immetiately jump into diagnostic mode
* For some reason the ``Scan from String`` function is not returning properly from the ``Get Data`` call on the ``CR5`` object.
* CR5 response is *slooooooowwwwww*
* ``Tamb`` is actually ``Tchamber`` - that is the temperature in the actual sample volume...  

### Flags

#### Mirror

The mirror flag that is returned indicates one of two values: 0 (clean) and 1 (not clean)

#### Flag

The ``Flag`` property indicates three possible values:

* 0 - not settled
* 1- settled on dewpoint
* 2 - Balance being executed

The balance cycle takes about 30 s it seems.
